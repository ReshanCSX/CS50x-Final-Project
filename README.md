#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/pNyFlQejgnw

## Description: 

Managing and tracking finances in a shared living or travel environment can be challenging. I have personally experienced this issue on multiple occasions. To address this problem, I have developed a web application that simplifies the process of tracking and splitting finances in a group setting.

This project was created specifically as a <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/project/">final project</a> for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science. </a>

## Practical Use:
Going on a trip with a group of people can be a lot of fun, but it can also be challenging to keep track of everyone's expenses and debts. When people are paying for various things, it can be difficult to calculate how much each person has spent and how much they owe to others. This can lead to confusion and frustration, especially when it comes time to settle up.

That's where this web application comes in. It has designed it specifically to help groups manage and track their finances in a clear and straightforward way. With this application, you can easily input and track each person's expenses, as well as calculate how much each person owes or is owed. This makes it simple to see at a glance who has spent what and how much each person owes or is owed.

In addition to tracking individual expenses, this application also provides a comprehensive overview of the group's total expenses for the entire trip. This helps everyone see exactly how much the group has spent and allows for more accurate budgeting and planning.


## Technologies:
This web application was developed using :
  
<ul>
  <li>Flask with python</li>
  <li>SQLAlchemy with SQLite3</li>
  <li> WTForms </li>
  <li>Flask-Login</li>
  <li>Bootstrap v5.2</li>
  <li>Fetch API</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>SCSS</li>
</ul>

## Conclusion

Developing this web application has been a valuable learning experience for me. Through the process, I have gained a deeper understanding of Python programming, as well as exposure to APIs, WTforms, and application security. I have also gained experience in designing meaningful database relationships, using GitHub to manage projects, debugging code, and utilizing online resources.

In addition to the technical skills I have acquired, I have also found the process of developing each feature and debugging problems to be enjoyable and rewarding. Overall, this project has provided me with a wealth of knowledge and experience that I can draw upon in the future.
