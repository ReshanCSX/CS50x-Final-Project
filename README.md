# SPLIT - Manage and track group finances

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: 

Managing and tracking finances in a shared living or travel environment can be challenging. I have personally experienced this issue on multiple occasions. To address this problem, I have developed a web application that simplifies the process of tracking and splitting finances in a group setting.

This was created specifically as a final project for CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science.

For this application I have used python with flask, html, CSS, and javascript.
